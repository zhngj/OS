Some of these tests can take a while to run
and because data gets buffered it may look
like they have appeared to stop when they
may still be running.

NOTE: These scripts use the csh.
NOTE: They require the PATH in your .cshrc
NOTE: to be set correctly so that commands like
NOTE: sys161 will be found.

ALSO NOTE: There are more tests in this directory than will be run
           and they may not run properly without creating and/or fiddling with 
           sys161.conf and the size of the SWAPFILE.

Fall 2010 Notes: It is probably a good idea to use a 9 MB swapfile.

There are 3 main high level sets of tests to run.

Each of these calls separate tests.
See the source for each of the high-level tests
to see how the sub-scripts are called.

run-batch-A3
   - Runs a bunch of tests in batch mode.
   - Probably best to run as:
     ./run-batch-A3 |& tee out.A3
   - These tests are the the non optional tests.
   - Some tests write to read-only pages.
   - Except for test-vm-consecutive, they require only very 
     simple write to console and exit (which can halt).
     test-vm-consecutive requires runprogram to return back
     to the menu after the program has exited.
   - These scripts call some of the new test programs for this
     assignment.

run-batch-A3-option1
   - Runs some optional tests that require more system calls
     to work. Mostly fork/waitpid/exit/execv.
   - Run as:
    ./run-batch-A3-option1 |& tee out.A3-option1

# Not used in W10/F10 because open, close and lseek aren't implemented
# run-batch-A3-option2
#    - Runs the full suite of A2 tests.
#    - Run as:
#     ./run-batch-A3-option1 |& tee out.A3-option2
# Note: that you can try using the A3 kernel with the a2 testing scripts
#       but we aren't going to worry about provide a separate set of tests for this.

run-batch-A3-all
   - Just a handy way to run the first two of the above
     Puts output into
     out.A3, out.A3-option1

For info about A2 tests. See the README from a2-test-scripts.

-------
New tests for this assignment:

vm-crash1 - each of these eventually
vm-crash2   writes to read-only pages
vm-crash3   and should crash the user program (not the kernel)

vm-data1  - each of these writes primarily (not exclusively)
vm-data2    to data pages
vm-data3

vm-stack1 - each of these writes primarily (not exclusively)
vm-stack2   to stack pages

vm-mix1       -  these tests touch pages in each of the different segments
vm-mix2       -  this one uses a bit more locality.
vm-mix1-fork  -  similar to vm-mix1 but two processes executing simultaneously

# We assume your directory structure is as follows
# $HOME/cs350-os161
# $HOME/cs350-os161/os161-1.11
# $HOME/cs350-os161/root
#
# And that kernel-ASST2 is compiled and installed in
# $HOME/cs350-os161/root

cd $HOME/cs350-os161/os161-1.11

# This creates the directory a3-test-script and its contents.
~cs350/bin/tar -xzf ~cs350/pub/os161_repository/a3-test-scripts.tar.gz

cd $HOME/cs350-os161
ln -s os161-1.11/a3-test-scripts .

cd a3-test-scripts

# This will build and install some new programs into
# the directory newtests and create some symbolic links
# to the kernel-ASST3 in the root directory and to
# testbin and bin in that directory.
# Note: that compilation of some of the new test programs
# can take a bit of time.
