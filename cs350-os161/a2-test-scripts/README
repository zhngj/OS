NOTE: These scripts use the csh.
NOTE: They require the PATH in your .cshrc
NOTE: to be set correctly so that commands like
NOTE: sys161 will be found.


There are 3 main high level sets of tests to run.
Each of these calls separate tests.
See the source for each of the high-level tests
to see how the sub-scripts are called.

The examples below assume you are using csh or tcsh as your shell.

run-batch
   - Runs a bunch of tests in batch mode.
   - Probably best to run as:
     ./run-batch |& tee out.1
   - This test saves testing bad parameters to
     system calls to the very end 
     (the tests are called badcalls).
     If you want to have the badcalls tests
     happen with the system calls being tested
     you can use the "inline" option:
     ./run-batch inline |& tee out.1

test-rw-con
   - runs tests that require console input so we
     must run interactively.
   - most programs echo input until q is typed
   - Run as:
    ./test-rw-con |& tee out.2

test-forkbomb
   - runs an infinite loop forking new threads
   - must run interactively
   - Run as:
    ./test-forkbomb |& tee out.3
    System shouldn't crash, so 
    after waiting sufficiently long 15-30 seconds type control-c
    If system crashes before you type control-c there is likely
    a kernel bug/problem.

test-a1 : currently isn't used/called but you can try it if you like
          This tests the synchronization code that was added for A1.
